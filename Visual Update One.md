In my first round of edits for my visual project, I started playing around with the idea I decided to use from my proposal. 
In my image, I am trying to promote kindness. I have to black shilloutes, the only differences between the two is one is 
saying mean words, while the other is saying nice words. I tried to make this difference evident with the differnt fonts. 
The font for the mean words is more impactful, it's bigger and harder. Where as the font for the kind words are in cursive, a soft
more welcoming font. I also used colors on the nice speaker, trying to get the point across when you are kind, you are lighter, 
you are more welcoming, and you have more going on inside you. 

I also used words to get my message across. I kept the top "In a world where you can be anything..." Nice and simple, so 
it catches attention and kind of stands out. I then put "Be Kind" in the bottom in cursive to match that of the kind words so 
people can once again draw that be kind and the kind words together. 

At the bottom I have #kindnessforkinsley, a campagin started by a family friend of mine who lost her 14 month-year-old daughter
last year.
