**Be Kind**

In my visual rhetoric, I am promoting kindness. As you can see, there are two faces one is mad and shouting out mean words 
and one is happy saying kind words. The person yelling mean words only had red and gray, anger and hate, in him. 
The person saying nice words is filled with color, happiness and kindness. 
Not only do you get the message to be kind from the two pictures, but there is also a quote I incorporated, "In a world
where you can be anything, be kind."
Everyone has the option to be anything they want every day and it is very important for people to be kind. 

This image was inspired by a non-profit Kindess for Kinsley, in memory of a little girl who passed away suddenly at the
age of 14 months. On the 15th of every month her family and friends spread kindness in her memory using #kindnessforkinsley.
